# The lookup keys are composed in:

#
# Supported hardware matches are:
#
#  - LEDs device tree name and machine's device tree compatible match
#      gmobile:name:<dtname>:dt:<compatible>*
#    <dtname> is the LED's name as specified in the device tree,
#    <model> is the first entry of the device tree's compatible
#    string from /sys/firmware/devicetree/base/compatible.
#
# Note that the format of this file might change without notice so device

# ######################### TORCH BRIGHTNESS #################################
#
# The torch brightness specifies a minimum torch brightness value that is
# useful to the user and clearly distinguishable from a `0` brightness.
# It should be great than zero and smaller than the LEDs maximum brightness.
#  GM_TORCH_MIN_BRIGHTNESS=10
# would set the minimum brightness to 10.
